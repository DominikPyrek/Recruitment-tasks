IMAP Email Processor

This project is a Python script that automates the processing of emails from an IMAP server. 
It fetches emails with a specific subject (e.g., "RED"), downloads attachments, saves the subject to a file, 
and moves processed emails to a designated folder (e.g., "OLD-RED"). The script is designed to run continuously, 
checking for new emails at regular intervals(base: 1min).

Before Using

Before running the script, you must edit the .env file to include your IMAP server credentials and configuration. This file is used to securely store sensitive information such as your username, password, and server details.

Features

    Attachment Handling: Downloads attachments from emails and saves them to a specified directory.
    Email Management: Moves processed emails to a designated folder (e.g., "OLD-RED") and marks them for deletion.
    Continuous Operation: Runs in an infinite loop, checking for new emails at a configurable interval.
